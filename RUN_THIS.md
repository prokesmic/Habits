# Run This Command

You're in the wrong directory. Run this:

```bash
cd "/Users/michal/Prague Family Events Cursor/Habit Tracker/habit-social"
npm run dev
```

Make sure you're in the `habit-social` folder, not the parent `Habit Tracker` folder!

To check you're in the right place, run:
```bash
pwd
```

It should show: `/Users/michal/Prague Family Events Cursor/Habit Tracker/habit-social`

If it shows something else, you need to `cd` into the `habit-social` folder first.
