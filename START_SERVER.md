# How to Start the Server

## You don't have pnpm installed, so use npm instead:

```bash
cd "/Users/michal/Prague Family Events Cursor/Habit Tracker/habit-social"
npm run dev
```

## The server should start and show:
- "Compiling..." or "Ready"
- A URL like "Local: http://localhost:3000"

## Once it says "Ready", open your browser to:
http://localhost:3000

You should see "Hello World" if everything is working!

## If you want to install pnpm later:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then you can use `pnpm dev` in the future.
