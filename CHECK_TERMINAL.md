# What to Check

## 1. Look at your terminal where `npm run dev` is running

**What does it show?** Copy/paste the entire output here.

It should say something like:
```
▲ Next.js 16.0.1
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
- Ready in 2.5s
```

OR it might say:
```
Compiling / ...
```

OR there might be errors in red.

## 2. Check your browser console

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Press F12 (or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
3. Click the "Console" tab
4. **What errors do you see?** Copy/paste any red errors

## 3. Check the Network tab

1. In the same DevTools, click "Network" tab
2. Reload the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
3. **Do you see any requests?** What's their status?
   - Are they pending?
   - Do they show errors?
   - Or is there nothing at all?

## 4. Try viewing the page source

Right-click on the blank page → "View Page Source" (or Cmd+Option+U)
**Do you see HTML?** Or is it completely blank?

Please share what you see in all of these!
